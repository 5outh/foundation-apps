          <h4>The Grid</h4>
          <p>Our new grid is built on Flexbox and includes many improvements over the Foundation 5 layout, including vertical grids, independently-scrollable panes, easier source ordering, and more.</p>

          <h4>Panels</h4>
          <p>Panels are frames that slide in from the top, left, bottom, or right of the screen and appear over the interface. Grid blocks can also transform into panels, allowing you to hide content off-canvas on smaller screens.</p>

        <section>
          <h4>Off-canvas</h4>
          <p>Off-canvas containers sit at the root level of your app to the left, right, top, or bottom. They are similar to panels, except the entire frame of your app shifts to display the off-canvas menu.</p>
