<h3>Version 1.0.2</h3>

<p><em>December 23, 2014</em></p>

<p><strong>Foundation for Apps is now on npm!</strong> <code>npm install foundation-apps</code></p>

<p><strong>Upgrading from an older version?</strong> We changed how our Angular plugins are structured, which means an existing app's build process will need to be changed slightly.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>If you're using our template stack as-is:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replace your existing <code>Gulpfile.js</code> with the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/gulpfile.js">new Gulpfile</a>.</li>
<li>Copy the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/client/assets/js/app.js">new app.js</a> file into the folder <code>client/assets/js/</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>If you need to upgrade a project with a custom build process:
<ul>
<li>To capture every plugin's JavaScript files in a single blob, use <code>bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/**/*.js</code>.</li>
<li>The Bower package no longer includes an <code>app.js</code> file. You can use our template stack's file as a baseline to write your own.</li>
<li>To capture every plugin's HTML template, use <code>bower_components/foundation-apps/js/angular/components/**/*.html</code>.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Codebase changes:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>#282: The Angular code has been refactored to be more streamlined and more modular. Each UI component now has its own folder, which includes the component's JavaScript and HTML template. The template stack has been updated to properly compile the new asset structure. <strong>If you're upgrading an existing project, follow the above instructions to get everything set.</strong>
<ul>
<li>The Bower package no longer includes an <code>app.js</code> file. Instead, a sample file has been included in the <code>client</code> folder of the template stack.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#108: Every Sass function now has a unit test. Run <code>gulp sass:test</code> to run the test suite.</li>
<li>#338: The Sass settings file is now automatically generated based on the variables inside each component's Sass file, with the command <code>gulp settings</code>. The <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-settings-parser">settings parser plguin</a> will be maintained as a separate codebase. The plugin pulls the variables out of each Sass file, after which:
<ul>
<li>Every component's variables are combined into one settings file, organized by component.</li>
<li>Each individual component's variables are output as an HTML partial, to be displayed on that component's documentation.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>New features:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Touch support!</strong> We added the <a href="http://ryanmullins.github.io/angular-hammer/">Hammer.js Angular library</a> to our codebase, which allows you to trigger functions with touch gestures, using directives like <code>hm-swipeup</code> and <code>hm-pinchin</code>.
<ul>
<li>We added one custom directive, <code>zf-touch-close</code>, which allows you to trigger the <code>close</code> event on an element by swiping. We'll add more features in future versions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>#301: Menu bars can now switch between the expanded and condensed styles at different screen sizes, using these classes: <code>condense</code>, <code>medium-condense</code>, <code>large-condense</code>, <code>medium-expand</code>, <code>large-expand</code>.</li>
<li>#335: Menu bars can now be wrapped in a <code>menu-bar-group</code> container, which allows two menu bars to sit on the same row, aligned to the left and the right. Learn more <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/apps/docs/#!/menu-bar">here</a>.</li>
<li>#342: The <code>src</code> attribute of an Iconic icon can now be dynamically inserted. Instead of <code>data-src</code>, define the icon's source with the <code>dyn-src</code> attribute on a <code>zf-iconic</code> element.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Version 1.0.0 RC1 — Mont Blanc</h3>

<p>It's our 1.0 release candidate! Thanks for stopping by to take a look.</p>

<h4>How to mess with it</h4>

<p>If you want a quick way to jump in, check out our <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template">starter template</a>, which has a basic directory structure and a blank index file for you to work with. Follow the instructions in the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps-template/blob/master/readme.md">readme</a> to get going.</p>

<p>The first thing you'll probably want to check out is the grid. If you compile this repo on your machine, you can find the grid documentation at <a href="http://localhost:8080/#!/grid">http://localhost:8080/#!/grid</a>. You can also view the source of that file <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/blob/master/docs/templates/grid.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>To incorporate our Sass components and Angular directives into your own project, install Foundation using Bower:</p>

<hljs>
bower install zurb/foundation-apps
</hljs>

<p>The JavaScript is organized into common components, specific directives, and vendor files. There's also a sample `app.js` that shows how to import the Foundation modules, but you'll likely want to set up your Angular application your own way.</p>

<h4>How to contribute</h4>

<p>We love feedback! We have a few <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-apps/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Adiscussion">discussion topics</a> open on our issue tracker, but if you have more specific feedback, please open a new issue! If you encounter any bugs, let us know as well. Be sure to specify the browser and operating system you're using, and show us how we can recreate the issue. Code samples are great!</p>

<h4>What's left</h4>

<p>The codebase is very close to feature-complete. Here are the things we're still working on:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Fully-working motion classes (see #113)</li>
 <li>Loose ends on components (see #109, #110, #111)</li>
 <li>Animation on directives (see #107)</li>
 <li>Unit tests for Angular and Sass (see #106)</li>
 <li>A finished settings file</li>
 <li>The command-line interface (being built in a separate repo, currently private)</li>
 <li>Testing, testing, testing</li>
</ul>
