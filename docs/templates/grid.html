## The Grid
<h3 class="subheader">Our new grid is built on Flexbox and includes many improvements over the Foundation 5 layout, including vertical grids, independently-scrollable panes, easier source ordering, and more.</h3>

***

## The App Frame

For most apps, you'll want to contain all of your UI elements in the space of the window, and then make certain sections of the app scrollable. To achieve this, wrap your entire app in a grid frame:

```html
<div class="grid-frame">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

The app frame always takes up 100% of the width and 100% of the height of the user's browser window.

## The Basics: Grid Blocks

Blocks are the... *building blocks* of apps in Foundation for Apps. They're flexbox-powered elements that can be intelligently sized, re-oriented, and re-ordered. Blocks are most analagous to rows in Foundation 5, but there's much more to them than that.

### Automatic sizing

You're probably used to pairing grid classes with sizing classes, like `.small-12`, `.medium-6`, and so on. In Foundation for Apps, when grid blocks don't have sizing classes, they take up an even amount of space.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

While these blocks *expand* to fill available space, it's also possible to have a block *shrink*, which means it only takes up as much space as its content needs. This is useful for title bars, tabs, or any other content that's secondary to the main content area.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div id="tabs" class="grid-block shrink"></div>
  <div id="main" class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

### Manual sizing

It's also possible to size the grid using column-based sizing classes. By default, the Foundation for Apps grid uses a 12-column grid, but you can change this by modifying the `$total-columns` variable in your settings file.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div id="sidebar" class="medium-4 grid-block"></div>
  <div id="main" class="medium-8 grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

### Parent-level sizing

Lastly, the sizing of blocks can be set on the parent, rather than individual children. Add the class `[size]-up-[n]` to a parent block to automatically size all children to be the same width. `[size]` is a breakpoint, like `small` or `medium`, and `n` is the number of items to fit on each row. By default, `n` only goes up to six, but this can be changed by modifying the `$block-grid-max-size` variable in your settings file.

```html
<div class="grid-block small-up-3">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

Note that this sizing method only works with horizontal grids.

## Content Blocks

If basic blocks are the *rows* of a Foundation for Apps layout, then content blocks are the *columns*. They can be sized and re-ordered just like normal blocks, but they're meant to house actual content, not just more blocks.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block">
    <div class="grid-content"></div>
    <div class="grid-content"></div>
  </div>
  <div class="grid-content"></div>
</div>
```

In the above example, you can see that `grid-content` elements are the bottommost elements of the basic layout. Use `grid-block` when you intend to keep nesting more blocks for your layout, and use `grid-content` when you're filling the element with "normal" content, like lists, text, tabs, or menus.

## The Vertical Grid

By default, blocks in a grid are layed out horizontally. A grid can be reoriented to be vertical by adding the `vertical` class to a parent element.

```html
<div class="vertical grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

This behavior doesn't cascade down to child blocksâ€”they'll be horizontal by default also.

You can also reorient the grid at different screen sizes by using adding breakpoint names to the classes.

```html
<div class="vertical medium-horizontal grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
  <div class="grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

## Other Options

There are many ways you can customize the grid, using either our grid classes or the grid mixins, which allow you to write cleaner, more semantic HTML.

### Wrapping items

By default, every block in a grid will try to fit on the same line&mdash;this is how Flexbox works. However, you can also force grid items to wrap when they take up too much space by adding the class `wrap` to the parent block. In the below example, the four child blocks will display on two rows, two per row:

```html
<div class="grid-block wrap">
  <div class="small-6 grid-block"></div>
  <div class="small-6 grid-block"></div>
  <div class="small-6 grid-block"></div>
  <div class="small-6 grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

### Container

By default, all grids stretch the full width and height available. However, it's possible to wrap a grid's content in a container with a maximum width.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-container">
    <!-- Content! -->
  </div>
</div>
```

The container aligns to the center of the block it's inside by default, but this can be changed by adding the class `contain-left` or `contain-right` to the container.

### Block Alignment

By default, all blocks in a grid align to the left of a grid, or the top if the grid is vertical. We can leverage the Flexbox `justify-content` property to easily re-align the blocks in a grid.

```html
<div class="align-right grid-block">
  <div class="small-4 grid-block"></div>
  <div class="small-4 grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

In this example, our blocks only take up eight columns of space, leaving four columns worth of empty space. By adding the `align-right` class to the parent block, the empty space will appear on the left instead of the right.

Grids can be aligned in five ways:
  - `align-left`: Blocks clump together on the left. This is the default.
  - `align-right`: Blocks clump together on the right.
  - `align-center`: Blocks clump together in the middle.
  - `align-justify`: Blocks spread out so that the space *between* each one is the same.
  - `align-spaced`: Blocks spread out so that the space *around* each one is the same.

(show examples here)

### Source Ordering

Blocks can be reordered to be different from the order they appear in the HTML. This is known as *source ordering*.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block order-2"></div>
  <div class="grid-block order-1"></div>
</div>
```

In the above example, the first child block will actually appear *after* the second one, because it has a lower order number. Blocks with the highest order number appear first in the layout. If multiple blocks share an order, they're then grouped by their order in the HTML.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <!-- 3rd -->
  <div class="grid-block order-2"></div>
  <!-- 1st -->
  <div class="grid-block order-1"></div>
  <!-- 2nd -->
  <div class="grid-block order-1"></div>
</div>
```

The ordering classes also come in responsive flavors, allowing you to reorder grid blocks at different screen sizes. In the below example, the two blocks will switch places on medium screens and larger.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="grid-block medium-order-2"></div>  
  <div class="grid-block medium-order-1"></div>  
</div>
```

### Offsets

The same offset classes from Foundation for Sites can be used in Foundation for Apps. To create a left-hand margin on a block, add the class `[size]-offset-[n]`, where `[size]` is a breakpoint name, and `[n]` is the number of columns to offset by. In the below example, the second column will be offset by 3, which is equal to 25% of the width of the entire container.

```html
<div class="grid-block">
  <div class="small-6 grid-block"></div>
  <div class="small-3 small-offset-3 grid-block"></div>
</div>
```

Offset classes allow you to fine-tune the spacing of blocks at different screen sizes. However, many common spacing options can also be achieved with the grid alignment classes described above.
